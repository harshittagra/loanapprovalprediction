# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval decisions using machine learning algorithms. Given a set of features related to loan applicants, such as credit score, income, and employment status, the goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected by a financial institution.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on loan applicants, including both approved and rejected applications. It consists of the following features:

1. Loan	       A unique id 
2. Gender	   Gender of the applicant Male/female
3. Married	   Marital Status of the applicant, values will be Yes/ No
4. Dependents  It tells whether the applicant has any dependents or not.

- Target Variable: Loan_Status (1 for approved, 0 for rejected).

## Models Explored
Several machine learning models were explored and evaluated for this prediction task, including:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Classifier
5. AdaBoost Classifier
6. Gradient Boosting Classifier
7. XGBoost Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## Best Model Selection
Based on the evaluation results, the best-performing model for loan approval prediction was determined to be [insert best model here]. This model achieved [insert performance metrics here].

## Usage
To use the trained model for loan approval prediction:

1. Install the required dependencies (Python libraries).
2. Load the trained model using the provided script or notebook.
3. Provide input features for a loan application.
4. Use the model to predict the loan approval decision (approved or rejected).

## Future Work
Potential areas for future improvement and extension of this project include:

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters of the selected model for better performance.
- Exploring additional features or alternative feature engineering techniques.
- Collecting more data to improve model generalization and robustness.
- Deploying the model as a web service or application for real-time loan approval prediction.
